# Kenya Poultry Vaccination Guide
## For Chickens Raised for Eggs and Meat

### Introduction
Vaccination is essential for successful poultry farming in Kenya. This guide covers vaccination schedules for broilers (meat), layers (eggs), and improved Kienyeji chickens, based on Kenyan agricultural practices and recommendations from KARI (Kenya Agricultural Research Institute) and leading hatcheries.

## Key Diseases to Vaccinate Against in Kenya

1. **Marek's Disease** - Highly infectious herpes virus, fatal if untreated
2. **Newcastle Disease (ND)** - 100% mortality rate if untreated, highly contagious
3. **Gumboro (Infectious Bursal Disease - IBD)** - Attacks immune system in young birds
4. **Infectious Bronchitis (IB)** - Respiratory disease affecting all ages
5. **Fowl Pox** - Spread by mosquitoes, causes lesions
6. **Fowl Typhoid** - Bacterial infection, up to 100% mortality
7. **Fowl Cholera** - Bacterial infection in older birds

## BROILER VACCINATION SCHEDULE (Meat Production)

**Duration: 6-8 weeks from hatch to market**

| Age | Vaccine | Method of Administration | Notes |
|-----|---------|-------------------------|-------|
| Day 1 | Marek's Disease | Subcutaneous injection (SC) or Intramuscular (IM) | Usually done at hatchery |
| Day 1 | Newcastle + IBD + IB (Optional) | Hatchery vaccination | Many Kenyan hatcheries (like Kenchic) now offer hatchery vaccination |
| Day 7 | Newcastle Disease (1st dose) | Eye drop or drinking water | If not done at hatchery |
| Day 10-14 | Gumboro (1st dose) | Drinking water or eye drop | Critical for immunity |
| Day 14 | Newcastle Disease booster | Eye drop or drinking water | Important booster |
| Day 18-21 | Gumboro (2nd dose) | Drinking water or eye drop | Second dose essential |
| Day 28 | Newcastle + IB | Drinking water | Final protection before market |

**Key Points for Broilers:**
- Broilers have a short life span (6-8 weeks), so vaccination schedule is condensed
- Focus is on fast-acting, high-impact disease prevention
- Many modern hatcheries provide day-1 vaccination, reducing on-farm vaccination stress
- Multivitamins should be given 2-3 days before and after vaccination

## LAYERS VACCINATION SCHEDULE (Egg Production)

**Duration: Up to 72 weeks or more**

| Age | Vaccine | Method of Administration | Notes |
|-----|---------|-------------------------|-------|
| Day 1 | Marek's Disease | Intramuscular (IM) injection | Must be done at hatchery or day 1 |
| Day 6 | Newcastle + IB | Eye drop | First respiratory protection |
| Day 10-14 | Gumboro (1st dose) | Eye drop or drinking water | Critical period |
| Day 18-21 | Gumboro (2nd dose) | Drinking water | Booster dose |
| Day 28 (Week 4) | Newcastle + IB | Drinking water | Respiratory booster |
| Week 6 | Fowl Pox | Wing stab | Before egg production starts |
| Week 8 | Fowl Typhoid | Intramuscular injection | Essential for long-term health |
| Week 16 | Deworming | Drinking water | Maintain health |
| Week 18+ | Newcastle + IB (every 2-3 months) | Drinking water | Ongoing protection during laying |

**Additional for Layers:**
- Continue Newcastle + IB boosters every 2-3 months throughout laying period
- Monitor egg production; drops may indicate need for vaccination
- Deworm every 6-8 weeks

## IMPROVED KIENYEJI CHICKEN VACCINATION SCHEDULE
### (KARI Improved Indigenous Chickens - Dual Purpose)

| Age | Vaccine | Method of Administration |
|-----|---------|-------------------------|
| Day 1 | Marek's Disease | Subcutaneous injection |
| Day 10 | Gumboro (1st dose) - IBD | Drinking water |
| Day 18 | Gumboro (2nd dose) - IBD | Drinking water |
| Week 3 (Day 21) | Newcastle Disease (1st dose) | Eye drop or drinking water |
| Week 3 (hot areas) | Fowl Pox | Wing web jab |
| Week 6 (cooler areas) | Fowl Pox | Wing web jab |
| Week 8 | Newcastle Disease (2nd dose) | Eye drop or drinking water |
| Week 8 | Fowl Typhoid | Intramuscular injection |
| Week 18 | Newcastle Disease (3rd dose) | Eye drop or drinking water |
| Week 19 | Deworming | Drinking water |

**Note:** Kienyeji chickens are more disease-resistant but still require vaccination. They are popular for both meat and eggs.

## METHODS OF VACCINE ADMINISTRATION

### 1. **Drinking Water**
- Withhold water for 1-2 hours before vaccination
- Use clean, chlorine-free water (below 20°C)
- Add skim milk powder (2g/L) to stabilize vaccine
- Ensure all birds drink within 1-2 hours
- Calculate water volume: provide enough for consumption in 1.5-2 hours

### 2. **Eye Drop**
- Most accurate method
- Use vaccine dropper
- One drop per eye
- Ensures 100% coverage
- Labor-intensive but effective

### 3. **Intramuscular (IM) Injection**
- For killed vaccines (Marek's, Fowl Typhoid)
- Inject into breast or thigh muscle
- Requires proper restraint

### 4. **Subcutaneous (SC) Injection**
- Under the skin, usually at back of neck
- For Marek's vaccine

### 5. **Wing Stab/Wing Web**
- For Fowl Pox vaccine
- Stab into wing web with double needle

## IMPORTANT VACCINATION TIPS FOR KENYAN FARMERS

### Before Vaccination
✓ Purchase chicks from reputable hatcheries that vaccinate at hatch
✓ Ask which vaccines were already administered
✓ Store vaccines at 2-8°C (refrigerator, NOT freezer)
✓ Check expiration dates
✓ Keep birds stress-free
✓ Ensure birds are healthy (NEVER vaccinate sick birds)

### During Vaccination
✓ Use clean equipment
✓ Follow dosage instructions precisely
✓ Keep vaccines cool during administration
✓ Avoid vaccination during extremely hot weather
✓ Do NOT use antibiotics on vaccination day

### After Vaccination
✓ Provide multivitamins 2-3 days before and after vaccination
✓ Monitor birds for adverse reactions
✓ Maintain good ventilation
✓ Provide stress-free environment
✓ Keep accurate vaccination records

## BIOSECURITY MEASURES

Vaccination alone is NOT enough. Combine with:

1. **Hygiene**
   - Clean and disinfect feeders and drinkers daily
   - Use footbaths with disinfectant at poultry house entrance
   - Regularly disinfect equipment

2. **Quarantine**
   - Isolate new birds for 2 weeks before introducing to flock
   - Restrict visitor access
   - Disinfect transport vehicles

3. **Sanitation**
   - Remove wet litter immediately
   - Prevent accumulation of droppings
   - Control rodents and wild birds

4. **Nutrition**
   - Provide balanced, quality feed
   - Ensure clean water always available
   - Supplement with vitamins and minerals

## VACCINE STORAGE AND HANDLING

- Store at 2-8°C (refrigerator temperature)
- NEVER freeze vaccines
- Protect from sunlight and heat
- Use cool boxes with ice packs when transporting to farm
- Shake liquid vaccines gently before use
- Reconstitute freeze-dried vaccines with provided diluent only
- Use reconstituted vaccines immediately (within 2 hours)

---

## COMMON VACCINATION MISTAKES TO AVOID

❌ Vaccinating sick birds
❌ Using expired vaccines
❌ Improper storage (freezing or overheating)
❌ Using chlorinated water for drinking water vaccination
❌ Vaccinating during extreme stress (heat, transport)
❌ Mixing different vaccines without guidance
❌ Not following booster schedules
❌ Using antibiotics on vaccination day
❌ Insufficient record keeping

## WHEN TO SEEK VETERINARY HELP

Contact a veterinarian immediately if you observe:
- Sudden high mortality despite vaccination
- Respiratory distress in multiple birds
- Nervous signs (twisted necks, paralysis)
- Severe diarrhea affecting many birds
- Drop in egg production (layers)
- Poor growth rates (broilers)

---

## COST CONSIDERATIONS

Vaccination costs in Kenya (approximate):
- Vaccines: KSh 3,000-5,000 per 100 birds for complete schedule
- This investment significantly reduces mortality and increases productivity
- Cost of NOT vaccinating: potential 50-100% flock loss

## CONCLUSION

A well-structured vaccination program is the foundation of successful poultry farming in Kenya. Combined with proper nutrition, biosecurity, and management, vaccination protects your investment and ensures:

- Better growth rates in broilers
- Consistent egg production in layers
- Safer, healthier meat and eggs for consumers
- Increased profitability

**Remember:** Vaccination schedules may vary based on your location, disease prevalence in your area, and specific conditions. Always consult with a qualified veterinarian or poultry specialist for guidance tailored to your farm.
